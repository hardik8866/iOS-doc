<p>Thank you for this tutorial as I learned immensely from it. I am experimenting and  added a UIBarButtonItem onto my navigation bar but to no avail. I added this in ThirdViewController. However, the navigation item is not displayed at all. The following is my code:</p><p>override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {</p><p>        var backButton: UIBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(title: "&lt; Back", style: UIBarButtonItemStyle.Bordered, target: self, action: "returnHome")</p><p>        navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = backButton</p><p>    }</p><p>Does anyone know what I am missing or doing wrong? Also, I removed the SwipeGesture routine to facilitate the aforementioned.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Mark</p>

<p>Thank you for an excellent tutorial, Gabriel.  I see that you are configuring custom segues and explicitly registering gesture recognizers in your code.  I wonder if the same thing can be accomplished in the interface builder by dragging and configuring "Swipe Gesture Recognizer" object into my View Controller?<br>If so, would you happen to have sample View/Code?</p>

<p>Excellent tutorial !Thank you very much! There is a autolayout problem when transition to VC3, using SecondCustomSegue animations. The Label will be positioned 20px above and than go down 20px after the animation is done. I think it's the problem with Top Layout Guide. How to fix that?</p>

<p>Excellent tutorial !! You saved my life! 3 weeks looking for information about segues without navigation controller.</p><p>This was perfect!</p><p>I would like to ask you a favor, if you do not mind. Even I have to add two more viewControllers, and would love you to explain how to making the transition to the side (left / right) without touch gesture. Just knowing that I must change to get it.</p><p>If you answer me, I buy your book. I promise.</p><p>Thank you so much !!</p><p>Have a nice day!</p><p>(I apologize for my English)</p>

<p>If you would like to perform the segue without a gesture, just perform it as a reaction to a button tap (like we did for the transition between VC1 and VC3 here).</p><p>If you would like the slide animation in VC1-VC2, but horizontally instead, just switch the screenHeight with screenWidth when setting the different frames. Also remember to switch from y to x. (instead of firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, 0.0, screenHeight), do firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, screenWidth, 0.0))</p>

<p>I did it myself and it works great. If you understand how the animations work (the math behind it), you won't mix it up. However, if you're just putting in numbers and don't know why, then it could easily become a mess.</p><p>If you can post your code here I could take a look and see where you're going wrong. </p>

<p>I assume you mean segue when saying view1 and unwind-segue when saying view2.<br>You have made a few small but important mistakes when positioning the views, here's the corrected frames:</p><p>View1:</p><p>// You are positioning the second view *to the right of* the first view. Therefore the anchorpoint (top left corner) of second view should be the screenwidth and 0.0, and the size is still screenWidth and screenHeight (don't mess those up)<br>secondVCView.frame = CGRectMake(screenWidth, 0.0, screenWidth, screenHeight)</p><p>// You are moving the views *to the left*, effectively decreasing their x-value and keeping the y-value at 0.0. Imagine secondView starting at (320, 0.0), it should go to (0.0, 0.0), and must therefore decrease by 320. The same for the firstView<br>firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, -screenWidth, 0.0)<br>secondVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(secondVCView.frame, -screenWidth, 0.0)</p><p>View2:</p><p>// This is actually correct. Nice job (Y)</p><p>I hope this makes you understand what you're doing and why you're doing it. It's important to pay attention and ask those questions when reading tutorials like this instead of just blindly doing what the instructor is doing. Good luck on all your future projects!</p><p>(I cannot guarantee the correctness of this code, it might not compile. I didn't copy all your code into Xcode and make sure it works, I simply looked over it and went from my memory. I also usually write in Objective-C, so there might be some mistakes there as well. The concept should be correct though, so if it doesn't compile just check for typing errors etc)</p>

<p>You would have to change setting y to screenWidth, to setting x to screenHeight.</p><p>For example, instead of <br>firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, 0.0, screenHeight)<br>, do <br>firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, screenWidth, 0.0)</p><p>And you would obviously have to change the gesture to recognize horizontal swipes instead, otherwise it'll look weird :)</p>

<p>Hello, Happy NY!</p><p>I faced a strange behaviour.</p><p>Firstly, In custom segues a VC should be direct ancestor of UIViewController.</p><p>If it's not a direct child of UIViewController, custom segue can't instantiate it. I don't get why.</p><p>I mean after transitioning instead of final VC, I see just black screen(absence of VC's view)</p><p>Secondly, I wanted to modulate behavior of open and closed vertically doors, i.e. something like SKTransition.doorsOpenVerticalWithDuration.</p><p>In unwind custom segue, I do see that changing destination(second VC) frame, allows to do manipulation with  source VC's view frame.</p><p>But I wanted just to scale to zero source VC's frame. So the dest VC looks like as been on BG.</p><p>I.e. in custom segue, source VC's looks like frozen and just dest VC's view expands, in unwind segue opposite direction.  Like swipe up &amp; down.</p><p>Why for instance the following doesn't work.</p><p>firstVCView.bounds = CGRectMake(0, 0, screenWidth, screenHeight)</p><p>        // Animate the transition.</p><p>        UIView.animateWithDuration(2.0, animations: { () -&gt; Void in</p><p>            secondVCView.bounds = CGRectMake(0, 0, screenWidth, 0)</p><p>            //firstVCView.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity</p><p>            firstVCView.bounds = CGRectMake(0, 0, screenWidth, screenHeight)</p><p>            }) { (Finished) -&gt; Void in</p><p>Can you suggest me how to do that?</p>

<p>Excellent tutorial. Very well written and explained. You did an great job Gabriel. Two comments.</p><p>1. Would be great to avoid using OBJ C syntax like ......var message: NSString!. Works just as well with String!</p><p>2. I found this statement to be very confusing but it works</p><p>firstVCView.transform = CGAffineTransformScale(thirdVCView.transform, 0.001, 0.001).</p><p>Should it be ?</p><p>firstVCView.transform = CGAffineTransformScale(firstVCView.transform, 0.01, 0.01)</p><p>3. Would be helpful to clarify that the code below should be placed outside of ViewDidLoad</p><p>func showSecondViewController() {<br>self.performSegueWithIdentifier("idFirstSegue", sender: self)<br>}</p><p>func showSecondViewController() {<br>self.performSegueWithIdentifier("idFirstSegue", sender: self)</p><p>}</p>

<p>Hi there,<br>Thanks a lot.</p><p>About your comments:<br>1. You're right. In this case I could have used the String datatype, instead of the NSString class. Old habits don't go away so easily.</p><p>2. No matter whether you set 0.001 or 0.01, it's important to specify a low value near to zero.</p><p>3. When a code block begins with the "func" keyword it means it is a function, and always is written out of the viewDidLoad or any other method. This is a basic principle, and that's why I didn't explicitly mentioned it.</p><p>Thanks for your feedback.<br>Best Regards</p>
