		<description><![CDATA[Hey thanks for this great tutorial! I have a small problem in my slide menu. Everything works fine but for one thing. When i slide the menu and select a menu and it navigates to the correct view controller but the selected menu item remains selected in the table view controller. I have to unselect it and then select it again to navigate to the respective view controller. I don&#039;t know where i&#039;m going wrong. Please can you help me with this..?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I need a little help. I downloaded the final project. I already have an app on the app store that I want to incorporate the side bar menu in. I have 7 views total. How do I modify the three views News, Maps, and photos. Add my own stuff and then connect a few more views. I deleted everything in the news view added my own stuff but when I went to run it it gave me an error. It should be that hard. kindly email me at timbojill@gmail.com with some advise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi @disqus_MzUtsNDoYF:disqus, I was unable to tell what exactly the problem was. Might be swift version or something else. I combined the tutorial here with another I found on YouTube: http://goo.gl/Gs11KA


With a little tweaks in in this tutorial from AppCoda plus the approach from the video in that link you can make it look and behave just like you find here. 


NB:
Some of the things missing in the linked YouTube tutorial is a navigation bar icon, view controllers that are not embedded in a navigation controller and also not pushing to the front view controller when cell is selected from the menu. 


You can solve all of that by applying some of the things Simon taught in this article.]]></description>
