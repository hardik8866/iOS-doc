		<description><![CDATA[So, I have implemented background fetch in my app with performFetchWithCompletionHandler and setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval:UIApplicationBackgroundFetchIntervalMinimum.

Requirement: In the handler, I am fetching remote data (1-2 second roundtrip) and comparing with existing data to see if there are changes. If changes exist, I display a local notification to the user.

Testing: I have modified the requirement to display local notifciation even if there is no change in data. ( So that I know background fetch works).

Issue: Background fetch does not work  when NOTconnected to xcode and app running in debug or release mode.

Observations:

In Xcode, app debug mode using simulator, when I do &quot;simulate background fetch&quot; multiple times, the handler is called and local notifications are fired as expected. I stop running the app.

In Xcode, app debug mode and the iphone device connected to xcode, when I do &quot;simulate background fetch&quot; multiple times, the handler is called and local notifications are fired as expected. I stop running the app.

In Xcode, app release mode (with new scheme) using iphone device, when I run the app in xcode, the handler is called and local notifications are fired as expected first time. I stop running the app.

I also tried creating a ad-hoc DEBUG and RELEASE schemes and installing it on my device via itunes, so that I dont have to run the app via xcode. This doesnt seem to make any difference either. The notification didn&#039;t even fire once.

I do understand that background fetch is started based on app usage. I keep opening and closing the app and manually  refreshing the data within the app to show activity. But I haven&#039;t seen any local notification firing at all.

For testing background fetch on my device without connecting xcode on debug or release modes, what should I do?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for the great tutorial!


a question regarding the 30s limit. though dev tries to finish his job in the app delegate callback as fast, given the nature of background fetch (often network requests involved) there&#039;s no way to guarantee it will be done in 30s. what exactly will happen when execution is halfway in the callback?


say to process the data I may have to allocate resources (let&#039;s say we use non-ARC), how do i ensure they are recycled?


thanks in advance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for the great tutorial.


I have a question on Data Loading.


I&#039;m using the same tutorial but I&#039;m pulling a big chuck of data
How can I ensure that all data are in before the table starts reloading.


Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great tutorial!


I have one question. 
I want to implement a timeout that actually stops the background fetch from reading the xml file if the timeout occures. 
So if the user swipes down the tableview to refresh the data, the timer should start, if the background fetch could not read any data after e.g. 20 seconds I want to stop the background fetch and pop out an error message &quot;please try again later&quot; or something. 
What would be the best place to implement this timeout function?


Thanks in advanced for your support!!
