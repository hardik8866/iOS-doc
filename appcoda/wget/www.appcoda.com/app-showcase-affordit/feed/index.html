		<description><![CDATA[Inspiring! Thanks a lot Appcoda for sharing these stories with us and also for all your wonderful tutorials!

I started learning IOS programming from last August because I wanted to share with my french speaking family-in-law a Chinese social game that I enjoy a lot playing with my friends. I learnt collectionview controller, tableview controller, pageview controller, localization, social media integration, remote notification and core data from Appcoda website. Your tutorials on these topics are very clear and easy to follow!! 

Now, since January 7, my app is available on App store :) This feeling is really wonderful!
For those who are interested, you can download my app for free at http://itunes.apple.com/app/id946882449

Please keep up your work :) and finally thank you again for making the life as a beginning programmer so much easier!]]></description>
