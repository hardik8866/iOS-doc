		<description><![CDATA[I need suggestions for buying my first personal mac computer. 

I have a 40 inch 1080p 60 Hz TV already and I was planning to go for the top model of mac mini. Since further change of configuration is not available in India, I can not opt for more RAM or swap the fusion drive with SSD.

With a maximum budget of $1100 (even with credit card EMIs), this is the only option I could think of; since it will allow me to connect the TV and use some screen estate for coding. (I like the idea of carrying around a macbook but the price difference and small screen for development again puts some constraints)

I have been working on a 2013 mid range iMac in office. Majorly I want to use Xcode, surf internet, write blogs and watch videos. But I also like editing videos and images while using Final cut pro and Photo shop sometimes.

Considering the fact that video editing is something I would seldom do, I am confused between the 3 models of mac mini. Should I simply buy the cheapest option or should I invest more and hope that the faster processing will pay off in terms of satisfaction and lesser waiting time?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Randy, long time no speak. Really sorry to hear you had a heart attack. Last I heard of you, you disappeared with my Urei 1176 and £300 I&#039;d given you for parts and labour for fixing it. It would be great if you could contact me about this at harrypurser at hotmail dot com. I wish I didn&#039;t have to resort to this mode of communication, but, as you know, you won&#039;t respond to my emails. Best wishes,

		<description><![CDATA[Last year i suffered two hefty heart Attacks and i was bound to Hospitalbed for several Weeks. I lost my Job but i did not wanted to stay at home and starve on boredom. I did a lot in PHP and Visual Basic and i tought i could try APP coding. But i was a total PC guy and had no experience in MAC Computers. So  bought a MacBook Air and two Big Books about APP Programming. After i got a lil Familiar with my new Toy i downloaded XCode and shortly after i found out the UI is totally different as the one in the Book. First Disapointment. The Books promise the latest Version (for iOS 7). However i tried to work with these books but my very first success i had was with a tutorial from this very nice Website. I am delighted. Please know that i am a total newbie in XCode and first it seems a bit difficult but that might be a result of being a new MAC user. However i am keen to learn new things. Lets see how far i get. Best Wishes from Switzerland
