		<description><![CDATA[This solves the issue in cellForRowAtIndexPath, but I am still having problems with deleting a row. This is the code I use. Every time I try to delete a row, I get a SIGABRT error. Please help! Thanks!

- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    [recipes removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    [thumbnails removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    [prepTime removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    [tableView reloadData];
}]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I ran into the same issue and the previously posted responses did not solve the issue because they weren&#039;t addressing the problem accurately. I believe that you may not have the correct object selected when attempting to change the class to RecipeDetalViewController, which is preventing the custom class from being created. Try to select the frame of the object (Detail View Controller) and you will likely grab the actual object you need to define a custom class for. Clicking inside the object will select the UIView object instead of the Detail View Controller. Now try assigning the custom class name of RecipeDetailViewController and hitting enter will give you that satisfying silence of a completed action sans error]]></description>
