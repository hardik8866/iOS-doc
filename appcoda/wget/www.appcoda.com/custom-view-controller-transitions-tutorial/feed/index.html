		<description><![CDATA[Awesome tutorial. Just one question. I&#039;m trying to build a modal that does not take over the whole screen and looks like an overlay. So I adjusted the &quot;toViewController.view.frame&quot; to the size I wanted and changed the Presentation of the segue in Storyboard to be &quot;Over Current Context&quot;. When I now dismiss the modal, I get a black screen as soon as the animation finished. I figured out that it&#039;s working if I remove the &quot;transitionContext.completeTransition(!transitionContext.transitionWasCancelled())&quot; from the dismiss controller but then the Main View is not getting active anymore and I can&#039;t click on any item there...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great tutorial.
But I was thinking that it is possible to get the same effect on view dismissal using auto layout, without creating snapshot.


When I have tried using aspect ratio constraint instead of Height restriction, I didn&#039;t get expected results. Why it is like that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is awesome!
Just one question, can you change the background in the last part (cube animation)?
Would it be possible to put an image or something?
Thank you so so much (Ps. I love this blog!!!!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting me know.


I&#039;d made some changes to the project while writing the tutorial and forgot to update the starter project. If you run the completed project, you&#039;ll see that those warnings aren&#039;t there.


In your project, to get rid of the warnings, delete the horizontal center alignment constraints on the image view and text view in the View Controller scene (they are redundant here anyway, since I&#039;m using trailing and leading space constraints).


The post will be updated with the correct starter project.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for a nice tutorial!

However you should probably use snapshotting in the CustomNavigationAnimationController as well, because I get a bunch of constraint errors e.g. Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints, Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint.]]></description>
