		<description><![CDATA[Why do you say you are doing the NSProgress jobs on a secondary thread? I see you are doing in the main thread. I think it&#039;s much better to make a queue and then call the dispatch_async.

dispatch_queue_t newQueue = dispatch_queue_create(&quot;ProgressQueue&quot;, NULL);
dipatch_async(newQueue, ^{
     //Perform nsprogress operations
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue( ), ^{
        //Update the UI
    });
});]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome tutorial! Are you planning on adding streaming? Because I have been trying to stream mic audio from one device to another and I can&#039;t figure it out for the life of me. I have the audio being processed using the the audio toolbox and it can listen and send the audio to the top speaker but I can&#039;t figure out how to stream it to a connected user... arrrr. Any help would be appreciated. thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Gabriel,
Thanks very much for the tutorial.  The Apple documentation on the MC framework is kind of sparse.
I&#039;m having trouble with your app when one device disconnects from the session.  If you try to reconnect, you get odd behaviour.  Sometimes it will work for a bit, then one device loses the connection while the other device believes it&#039;s still connected.  Other times it just won&#039;t connect at all.
I tried setting up my own connection and got the same thing.
So if you try disconnecting one device, all is fine, but if you try to reconnect and use the app, it doesn&#039;t quite work.
Is this known? Is there a way to work around it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Gabriel,
I have a question, could you possibly do a tutorial on connecting between peers without going through the MCBrowserView? For example, two anonymous users connecting automatically and transferring data (maybe using a popup stating - connect with someone: accept/decline). 
The MCBrowserView is just a bit restrictive if it&#039;s not completely necessary to select a particular user. Thank you and keep up the great info!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi


Thanks for the awesome tutorial. This is very helpful for understanding the multi-peer frameworks.


I have a question...please help me out to how can i share the one device internet from this app to other devices. Do we need to have the other devices with the same app installed on them?? if so how can i share the device internet (wifi/3g/2g) from this demo app so that the other device can use the internet from the main device. In this case &quot;other devices&quot; i mean either IOS or Android devices or both.


Please help me out. Thank you.]]></description>
