		<description><![CDATA[I have imported the MultipeerConnectivity, but when I add MCSessionDelegate, MCNearbyServiceBrowserDelegate, and MCNearbyServiceAdvertiserDelegate, i get an error stating that MPCManager do not conform to protocol. Can u please tell me what may be doing wrong? Thank you. Im sure its something simple, but i can&#039;t figure it out]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it possible to send an user profile image data/NSUrl with MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser declaration in DiscoveryInfo param? I tried to send NSUrl as advertiser&#039;s profile image, but it turned to runtime error. Though I noticed I can pass String values through DiscoveryInfo in MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser. Any help?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off I&#039;d like to thank you for giving me the opportunity of learning this stuff from AppCoda.
Your tutorials are far more advanced than other ones in Swift you can e.g. find on YouTube.


That&#039;s why I&#039;m wondering where you got this knowledge of Swift from. Are there any other tutorials/references/books you can suggest to me?


Thanks in advance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the process of creating a real-time card game, and I was considering using MPC for it, but after reading the tutorial an other blog posts, I&#039;m wondering whether is something worth even attempting.


Do you think it&#039;s possible to create a card game for multiple players with this technology at this point in time? That is, without having to invest countless hours creating work-arounds for bugs, and general unreliability? Would real-time matches using Game Kit be a better option?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From what I&#039;ve read bout MPC, you can&#039;t set which medium it uses to communicate.  The device decides on it&#039;s own if bluetooth or wifi should be used.  Bluetooth has a shorter range, so I think if you test with the devices far enough apart it will force it to switch to wifi.  Also try just turning off bluetooth but i&#039;m not sure if that will deactivate the MPC connectivity overall.]]></description>
