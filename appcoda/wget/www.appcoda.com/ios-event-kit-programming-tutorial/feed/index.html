		<description><![CDATA[I had the same issue and found that if I added a &quot;break;&quot; statement at the end of each switch case of the saveEvent method the app worked fine. I had downloaded the completed project and tried comparing my source with the downloaded version. I found that the downloaded code was also missing those break statements. Not sure if there is a better way but that does seem to have fixed the issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Gabriel,

Thanks for your reply!

I&#039;ve searched for this problem for about a week. I&#039;ve got some answers on quora but with not much help. They give me the same answer--&quot;Apple will not give developers those permission&quot;. But I was curious about this problem. Why just the data in notes.app is completely closed while I could get any data from other icloud product like iCal, reminder, contacts? Is the data in notes more secure than any other icloud data? Hmm, might be.

There is a personal solution on the web:
http://blog.rootshell.be/2013/01/11/managing-apple-icloud-notes-with-python/

It&#039;s a python script that can CRUD your icloud notes, but it requires user&#039;s icloud credential which is not acceptable to anyone.

I&#039;m going to quit this feature in my app. If you got some solution, wish you could share that. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks.


Even though I&#039;ve never tried to import notes from the Notes app, I can just say that I&#039;m not so sure if you&#039;re allowed to do that. Apple doesn&#039;t like people to play with their apps, excluding just a few of them.


Maybe a general search on the web could return you some interesting results.]]></description>
