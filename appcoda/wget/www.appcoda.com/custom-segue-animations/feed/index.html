		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this tutorial as I learned immensely from it. I am experimenting and  added a UIBarButtonItem onto my navigation bar but to no avail. I added this in ThirdViewController. However, the navigation item is not displayed at all. The following is my code:

override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {

        var backButton: UIBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(title: &quot;&lt; Back&quot;, style: UIBarButtonItemStyle.Bordered, target: self, action: &quot;returnHome&quot;)

        navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = backButton

    }





Does anyone know what I am missing or doing wrong? Also, I removed the SwipeGesture routine to facilitate the aforementioned.


Any help would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,
Mark]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for an excellent tutorial, Gabriel.  I see that you are configuring custom segues and explicitly registering gesture recognizers in your code.  I wonder if the same thing can be accomplished in the interface builder by dragging and configuring &quot;Swipe Gesture Recognizer&quot; object into my View Controller?
If so, would you happen to have sample View/Code?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent tutorial !Thank you very much! There is a autolayout problem when transition to VC3, using SecondCustomSegue animations. The Label will be positioned 20px above and than go down 20px after the animation is done. I think it&#039;s the problem with Top Layout Guide. How to fix that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello again. Thank you very much for your patience.

Now it works much better, but I&#039;ve noticed that the problem is in the segueUnWind (view2).

The fact is that I have a deployed sliderbar and change the vista2 to vista1 does something strange and looks SlideBar.

I&#039;ll leave the gif.

The animation is when I press the button Social.

		<description><![CDATA[I assume you mean segue when saying view1 and unwind-segue when saying view2.
You have made a few small but important mistakes when positioning the views, here&#039;s the corrected frames:

View1:

// You are positioning the second view *to the right of* the first view. Therefore the anchorpoint (top left corner) of second view should be the screenwidth and 0.0, and the size is still screenWidth and screenHeight (don&#039;t mess those up)
secondVCView.frame = CGRectMake(screenWidth, 0.0, screenWidth, screenHeight)

// You are moving the views *to the left*, effectively decreasing their x-value and keeping the y-value at 0.0. Imagine secondView starting at (320, 0.0), it should go to (0.0, 0.0), and must therefore decrease by 320. The same for the firstView
firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, -screenWidth, 0.0)
secondVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(secondVCView.frame, -screenWidth, 0.0)



View2:


// This is actually correct. Nice job (Y)


I hope this makes you understand what you&#039;re doing and why you&#039;re doing it. It&#039;s important to pay attention and ask those questions when reading tutorials like this instead of just blindly doing what the instructor is doing. Good luck on all your future projects! 


(I cannot guarantee the correctness of this code, it might not compile. I didn&#039;t copy all your code into Xcode and make sure it works, I simply looked over it and went from my memory. I also usually write in Objective-C, so there might be some mistakes there as well. The concept should be correct though, so if it doesn&#039;t compile just check for typing errors etc)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello again and thanks for answering so quickly.

Excuse my ignorance, but I thought it was a guide for beginners. Obviously not understand much of mathematics animations but I am very excited and eager to learn and that is why I asked. I again thank you for responding.

I&#039;m sure the error is mine because practically just did what you said.

This is the code view 1:

 override func perform() {

        // Assign the source and destination views to local variables.

        var firstVCView = self.sourceViewController.view as UIView!

        var secondVCView = self.destinationViewController.view as UIView!

        

        // Get the screen width and height.

        let screenWidth = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.size.width

        let screenHeight = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.size.height

        

        // Specify the initial position of the destination view.

        secondVCView.frame = CGRectMake(screenHeight, screenWidth, screenHeight, 0.0)

        

        // Access the app&#039;s key window and insert the destination view above the current (source) one.

        let window = UIApplication.sharedApplication().keyWindow

        window?.insertSubview(secondVCView, aboveSubview: firstVCView)

        

        // Animate the transition.

        UIView.animateWithDuration(0.4, animations: { () -&gt; Void in

            firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, screenWidth, 0.0)

            secondVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(secondVCView.frame, screenWidth, 0.0)

            

            }) { (Finished) -&gt; Void in

                self.sourceViewController.presentViewController(self.destinationViewController as UIViewController,

                    animated: false,

                    completion: nil)

        }

        

    }

   

}

And here&#039;s the view2:

 override func perform() {

        // Assign the source and destination views to local variables.

        var secondVCView = self.sourceViewController.view as UIView!

        var firstVCView = self.destinationViewController.view as UIView!

        

        let screenWidth = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.size.height

        

        let window = UIApplication.sharedApplication().keyWindow

        window?.insertSubview(firstVCView, aboveSubview: secondVCView)

        

        // Animate the transition.

        UIView.animateWithDuration(0.4, animations: { () -&gt; Void in

            firstVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(firstVCView.frame, screenWidth, 0.0)

            secondVCView.frame = CGRectOffset(secondVCView.frame, screenWidth, 0.0)

            

            }) { (Finished) -&gt; Void in

                

                self.sourceViewController.dismissViewControllerAnimated(false, completion: nil)

        }

        

    }

   

}]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did it myself and it works great. If you understand how the animations work (the math behind it), you won&#039;t mix it up. However, if you&#039;re just putting in numbers and don&#039;t know why, then it could easily become a mess. 

If you can post your code here I could take a look and see where you&#039;re going wrong. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much but does not work.

I want the same animation to the viewcontroller 1 to viewcontroller 2, but from left to right.
With what you said animations are mixed.

It&#039;s a shame, I think I will not do so.]]></description>
