		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think that&#039;s possible...

Here&#039;s what I know of extensions:

Extensions run in their own processes. They don&#039;t even run in the same process as the container app. Every instance of the extension runs as its own process, for example if you had an extension that can be invoked by the Photos app and Safari. If a user brings up the extension in Safari and then switches to the Photos app and brings up the same extension, if the other instance is still running, then there will be two separate instances of the extensions running.

While running, an extension can communicate directly only with the host app. It can&#039;t even communicate directly with the container app (it can indirectly through a shared data container - which provides a place where the extension and container app can read and write data - which is what we used in the example).

So extensions really cannot provide inter-process communication between apps or even between the container and host app.

I hope that answers your question.]]></description>
