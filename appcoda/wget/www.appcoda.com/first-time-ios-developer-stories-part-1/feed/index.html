		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alexandra, thank you for the kind words. Your app is a really interesting idea, I think the practical application of apps such as yours is fantastic, just a shame I&#039;m not near Florence right now ha! 

I know I really could/should have done more to promote Rare, but as I&#039;m new to all of this and I suppose I&#039;m targeting such a niche set of users it&#039;s been difficult to generate any excitement about a food timer! You sound like you know a lot more about promoting/marketing, I need to do some research clearly - Google Keywords sounds like a good plan. 

Glad you like the UI, I&#039;ve been trying my hand at graphic design while I&#039;ve been learning to code. I&#039;m already working on my next app now (although work is slow thanks to my dissertation), but I&#039;ll be sure to see what you think of it when it&#039;s ready! 

Many thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Simon, thanks for featuring me and the Uffizi app. I enjoyed reading the other new programmers&#039; stories. 



George&#039;s rare steak timer is hilarious. Such a simple concept and I love the clean graphics. George, you really need to do more to promote this, it is brilliant! How about doing a promotional price, and then send a press release to a ton of app review sites as well as cooking blogs. Make a funny viral video about getting the steak cooked wrong. Make it with a good seo title using google keyword search to figure out what people are looking up. I bet &quot;how to cook steak&quot; is a popular term and you could position your app around that. Don&#039;t give up now!]]></description>
