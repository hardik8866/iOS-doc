		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Programming News: Introduction to UIAlertController, Swift Closures and Enumeration Among all the changes in iOS 8 SDK, the change of two commonly-used APIs in UIKit framework is less known. Both UIActionSheet and UIAlertView classes are now replaced by the UIAlertController class. In iOS 8, whenever you want to display an alert message in your app, you should use UIAlertController instead the two deprecated classes. The action sheet and alert view become the style of the UIAlertController. You choose one of the styles when creating an alert controller. The way to handle button action is redesigned. You no longer use delegate (e.g. UIAlertViewDelegate) to handle user response. When using UIAlertController, you associate actions with the controller and that the action is expressed as a block in Objective-C or closures in Swift. Read full story =&gt; AppCoda [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This shorter dot syntax results in your having to type less code and makes your code more readable.&quot;

We type code in Xcode and the auto completion engine there does a good job too. We are not coding using vi or TextEdit. Also, removing the enum name is similar to not using argument names in methods... It decreases readability, not the opposite. Same thing for variables named mgr or actVC

self.setupEngineParameters(true, false, false, self, true) 

Leads to the reader asking about what one of those Boolean is used for and the other person answering by pointing out that somewhere documentation is available. Tell me you never asked such a question about a C++ or Java function call and hear the same response ;)

A language should value its ability to be self-documenting :).]]></description>
