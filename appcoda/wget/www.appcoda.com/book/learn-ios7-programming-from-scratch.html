<h1>Learn iOS Programming from Scratch</h1>
<h2 class="subheader"><strong>A Step by Step Guide to Build Your iOS App</strong></h2>
</hgroup>
<!--End of Banner Title-->

<p>Do you find it hard to learn iOS programming and create your first iOS app? If you're new to Objective-C and programming, creating an iOS app from scratch may be difficult for you. You may have read some programming books and followed a few code samples but it just doesn't work out very well. </p>
<p>
From my experience, the best way to learn a new programming language is to 'Get your hands dirty'. It's very similar to learning a foreign language. You can't just read a book and teach yourself the language. You have to practice! That's the same when studying a new programming language. So this book will take you through a similar learning adventure and teach you everything you need to build your first apps on iOS 7. It is a very practical guide based on the tutorials of our popular programming course. It's not a book that just teaches you theory. You'll get lots of hands-on exercises and projects. In each chapter, you'll learn how to build a real app with some really cool features. </p><p>The book assumes you have little or even no prior programming experience. With tons of illustrations and screenshots, I'm sure you'll be able to follow the guide easily. Other than a 400-page book, you also get full source code for your own use. And you'll get free update when iOS 8 is officially released. Interested?</p>

I've been programming for just about 10 years and started dabbling in iOS development about 1 and a half years ago. The real world examples and progress through the development of the recipe app make it easy to understand and relate to real world projects I am working on.</q>

<h2>Practical Guide for Complete Beginners</h2>
<h3>The book is written for those with little or even no programming experience.</h3>
</hgroup>

<p>You want to build an app but think it's too difficult to get started? I understand that it's not easy to learn iOS programming especially you do not have any prior programming experience. The book is written with this in mind. It includes step-by-step instructions and tons of illustrations/screenshots to guide you through.</p><p>I believe programming should be fun to learn. Instead of just elaborating the programming concept, you'll learn mostly by doing. You'll get lots of hands-on exercises and create loads of apps in this 30-chapter book.</p><p>The "Get Your Hands Dirty" way is the best way to learn a new programming language. Right from the very beginning of the book, we'll build a simple iPhone app together. You'll get an idea how easy you can create an app. Don't believe it? Go ahead to download the sample chapters and take a look.</p>

<li class="one_half"><h4>WHICH PACKAGE SHOULD I BUY?</h4><p>This depends on your budget and plan. Obviously, the complete package is the most comprehensive.
