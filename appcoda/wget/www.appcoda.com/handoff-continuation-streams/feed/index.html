		<description><![CDATA[Hi! 
Nice tutorials!
I&#039;m trying to implement Handoff in my app and I need to transport arrays containing among other things UIImage, so I need continuation streams, but even though I followed your tutorial, I can&#039;t get the streams to be initialized properly, the getContinuationStreams always has an error saying &quot;Connection Lost&quot;, and the inputStream and outputStream are both  nil
The delegate method didReceiveInputStream doesn&#039;t seem to be called on the sending app, even though userActivityWasContinued is called after I get the error on the receiving device
Any ideas?
Thanks]]></description>
