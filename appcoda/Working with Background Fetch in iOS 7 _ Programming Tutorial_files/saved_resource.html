<p>Nice tutorial!<br>I have a few queries though.</p><p>I have an application where I want to download data using the Background Fetch and then insert/update my local database.</p><p>So my doubts are as follows:</p><p>1. Is it possible that applicationWillEnterForeground and performFetchWithCompletionHandler occur simultaneously ? ( If yes, I might end-up having a SQL deadlock )</p><p>2. I want performFetchWithCompletionHandler to be called only once a week. Can I just set the NSTimeInterval to 604800 s ? ( There was a huge battery drain when i set the interval to UIApplicationBackgroundFetchIntervalMinimum )</p><p>Would be grateful if you clarify my doubts.</p><p>Thank you very much once again!</p>

<p>Very very nice tutorial! Thank you very much!</p><p>Two issues.</p><p>1. Just as a note. iOS Refresh control has ability to show text string below animated activity indicator and it would be nice to have last updated date there - to decide whether you need to refresh content or not. But! As far as I've seen this in my application sometimes this control is not properly rendered and animated indicator is placed over the top area of the text message. Commercial applications would not relay on this control while the bug is not fixed.</p><p>2. The main problem (and pain!) with data downloading could be the Internet connection. I would prefer to have XML parser working in a separate thread using HTTP request rather than passing XML URL directly to the parser. In this case app main thread will not be blocked if something goes wrong and there could more possibilities to check the errors. It could be very useful if you plan to "slightly" modify this tutorial to have a separate thread for downloading and parsing.</p><p>Thank you very mach again!</p>

<p>So, I have implemented background fetch in my app with performFetchWithCompletionHandler and setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval:UIApplicationBackgroundFetchIntervalMinimum.</p><p>Requirement: In the handler, I am fetching remote data (1-2 second roundtrip) and comparing with existing data to see if there are changes. If changes exist, I display a local notification to the user.</p><p>Testing: I have modified the requirement to display local notifciation even if there is no change in data. ( So that I know background fetch works).</p><p>Issue: Background fetch does not work  when NOTconnected to xcode and app running in debug or release mode.</p><p>Observations:</p><p>In Xcode, app debug mode using simulator, when I do "simulate background fetch" multiple times, the handler is called and local notifications are fired as expected. I stop running the app.</p><p>In Xcode, app debug mode and the iphone device connected to xcode, when I do "simulate background fetch" multiple times, the handler is called and local notifications are fired as expected. I stop running the app.</p><p>In Xcode, app release mode (with new scheme) using iphone device, when I run the app in xcode, the handler is called and local notifications are fired as expected first time. I stop running the app.</p><p>I also tried creating a ad-hoc DEBUG and RELEASE schemes and installing it on my device via itunes, so that I dont have to run the app via xcode. This doesnt seem to make any difference either. The notification didn't even fire once.</p><p>I do understand that background fetch is started based on app usage. I keep opening and closing the app and manually  refreshing the data within the app to show activity. But I haven't seen any local notification firing at all.</p><p>For testing background fetch on my device without connecting xcode on debug or release modes, what should I do?</p>

<p>thanks for the great tutorial!</p><p>a question regarding the 30s limit. though dev tries to finish his job in the app delegate callback as fast, given the nature of background fetch (often network requests involved) there's no way to guarantee it will be done in 30s. what exactly will happen when execution is halfway in the callback?</p><p>say to process the data I may have to allocate resources (let's say we use non-ARC), how do i ensure they are recycled?</p><p>thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Thanks for the great tutorial!</p><p>I have one question. <br>I want to implement a timeout that actually stops the background fetch from reading the xml file if the timeout occures. <br>So if the user swipes down the tableview to refresh the data, the timer should start, if the background fetch could not read any data after e.g. 20 seconds I want to stop the background fetch and pop out an error message "please try again later" or something. <br>What would be the best place to implement this timeout function?</p><p>Thanks in advanced for your support!!<br>Regards</p>

<p>An interesting article. Thanks. May I pick up on your point "Let me do a clarification at this point, regarding the usage of the Background Fetch. It is not intended to work only with online data, but it can be used to perform tasks internally into an app too. However, that’s a rare case, as the most common usage involves data fetching from the web.". I have ben unable to find anything from Apple that states this is for anything but online data, and was for that reason I hadn't used it so far. <br>I am keen to use this for periodical updates to an app, processing locally gathered data, to ensure that it is up to date as the user re-opens the app, but also to allow for local notifications to the user as any of this local data that is processed meets certain thresholds. I realise the timings are not guaranteed, and I am not overly concerned by this, but having the ability for the app to briefly refresh circa every 3 to 6 hours, with what would amount to a few seconds of processing would be fantastic.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tutorial!  You mentioned that background fetch's should not be used for critical updates.  What should be used for critical updates if your program is running in the background?   I have an alert app and it is critical that the user gets the alerts in a timely manor, within seconds of them being issued.   I have tried push notifications, and they work mostly, but sometimes Apple's push servers can take minutes to deliver the notice, and that is unacceptable.    The alerts are very small, and 99% of the time that background fetch would retrieve no data at all (an all clear) so I figured regular background fetches would be perfect.   Any thoughts on that?  Or is there a better way?   Thanks</p>

<p>Hi there! I hope it's not too late to answer.</p><p>The reason that the background fetch should not be used for critical updates is just because the operating system may not allow it to work as many times as you want, if you make fetches very often. It doesn't play any role at all if it gets data indeed or not, it's all about if it will be fired or not. If your app requirements do not demand quite often fetches, then of course you can use it, especially if you found out that this is the best tool for you.</p><p>Have you considered using remote notifications? If you want, take a look <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-7-sdk-mutlitasking-enhancements--mobile-20295" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where I discuss in short about them.</p><p>Also, if there's a remarkable amount of data that needs to be downloaded, then you must use background fetch along with the background transfer service (stay put, a tutorial regarding it is coming soon).</p><p>Regardless of all the above and as a final word, I would tell you to keep on going with background fetch, and see how the system will behave. If you see in action that your updates take place normally and you don't miss any, you're just fine. Think only of another solution if that won't work for you.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>Please forgive my late answer. Well, the 50-70 secs that the background fetch lasts could be a Simulator "problem" that allows to exceed the 30 secs limit. If you need more than 30 secs, then you should schedule a download using the <em>Background Transfer Service</em> within that timeframe, and let the system do the job for you, no matter how much time is needed.</p><p>Stay put, as in a few days a new tutorial regarding the Background Transfer Service is going to be published.</p>
