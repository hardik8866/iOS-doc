<p>Awesome tutorial! Are you planning on adding streaming? Because I have been trying to stream mic audio from one device to another and I can't figure it out for the life of me. I have the audio being processed using the the audio toolbox and it can listen and send the audio to the top speaker but I can't figure out how to stream it to a connected user... arrrr. Any help would be appreciated. thanks</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel,<br>Thanks very much for the tutorial.  The Apple documentation on the MC framework is kind of sparse.<br>I'm having trouble with your app when one device disconnects from the session.  If you try to reconnect, you get odd behaviour.  Sometimes it will work for a bit, then one device loses the connection while the other device believes it's still connected.  Other times it just won't connect at all.<br>I tried setting up my own connection and got the same thing.<br>So if you try disconnecting one device, all is fine, but if you try to reconnect and use the app, it doesn't quite work.<br>Is this known? Is there a way to work around it?</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel,<br>I have a question, could you possibly do a tutorial on connecting between peers without going through the MCBrowserView? For example, two anonymous users connecting automatically and transferring data (maybe using a popup stating - connect with someone: accept/decline). <br>The MCBrowserView is just a bit restrictive if it's not completely necessary to select a particular user. Thank you and keep up the great info!</p>

<p>Hi</p><p>Thanks for the awesome tutorial. This is very helpful for understanding the multi-peer frameworks.</p><p>I have a question...please help me out to how can i share the one device internet from this app to other devices. Do we need to have the other devices with the same app installed on them?? if so how can i share the device internet (wifi/3g/2g) from this demo app so that the other device can use the internet from the main device. In this case "other devices" i mean either IOS or Android devices or both.</p><p>Please help me out. Thank you.</p>

<p>Wow Gabriel, this post is just amazing. Firstly, thanks for the wonderful introduction to a very special framework. But I have a query here. Something's not working for me ! And I don't have much experience so I just thought I will clear it this way.</p><p>Well, the thing is, I created a network on my Macbook Pro and I had 2 iOS 7 (iPad 2 &amp; iPod Touch) devices join to this network. When I started Browse for devices, I just have the "Searching " and the wheel spinning. Apparently one device is not discovering the other device. But the setup works when I have bluetooth switched ON on both. Please, can you help me with this ?</p>

<p>Hi,<br>Firstly, thanks a lot!</p><p>In your problem now, what exactly do you mean when saying you created a network on your Macbook? Normally, simply by having your 2 iOS devices sharing the same WiFi network you should be able to discover them. Try to delete the demo app from your devices and re-install them. Also, make sure that all IBOutlet properties have been connected to the appropriate controls, in the ConnectionsViewController class. Finally, make sure that your WiFi works fine and without problems.</p><p>I hope something from all these work for you.</p><p>Gabriel</p>

If not in this way, please suggest me the alternate. <br>Also, I have the same issue when I run the code downloaded from this site.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Nithin</p>

<p>Hi,<br>Make sure that you have only one WiFi service enabled, and don't add an extra service (such as WiFi 2) just to test the app. This is probably your problem. I've tested it in a couple of different WiFi networks and I had no problem at all. If that's the case, there must be a conflict to your network that should be resolved first.</p>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Firstly, thank you very much!</p><p>Surely, you can establish a connection between two peers only, as long as none of them will invite other people to the session. Also, before a connection gets established, a confirmation alert view appears which you can use to decline other invitations made to you.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what exactly you mean with the location, so please explain more if you'd like.</p><p>Lastly, I guess that when you're saying about adding a camera, you mean to implement live chat. Well, what you actually want to do here is to perform streaming between the peers, and that's the third purpose of the multipeer connectivity framework, and also the one that was not covered in any of these two tutorials. If you manage to implement streaming, then combining it with the multipeer connectivity wouldn't be hard. Anyway, the final answer is yes, you can have live cam functionality.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p><p>Yes, you can do it; here are the steps in a list format:</p><p>1. Capture the image you want with the camera of your device.</p><p>2. Save it as a .png or .jpg file on the documents directory.</p><p>3. Use this file and the Multipeer Connectivity to send it to other nearby devices.</p><p>If you are not sure how to perform the first two steps, just make a search on the web and you'll find all you need there.</p><p>Good luck!</p>
